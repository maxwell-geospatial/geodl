\arguments{
\item{inChn}{Number of channels, bands, or predictor variables in the input
image or raster data. Default is 3.}

\item{nCls}{Number of classes being differentiated. For a binary classification,
this can be either 1 or 2. If 2, the problem is treated as a multiclass problem,
and a multiclass loss metric should be used. Default is 3.}

\item{actFunc}{Defines activation function to use throughout the network. "relu" =
rectified linear unit (ReLU); "lrelu" = leaky ReLU; "swish" = swish. Default is "relu".}

\item{useAttn}{TRUE or FALSE. Whether to add attention gates along the skip connections.
Default is FALSE or no attention gates are added.}

\item{useSE}{TRUE or FALSE. Whether or not to include squeeze and excitation modules in
the encoder. Default is FALSE or no squeeze and excitation modules are used.}

\item{useRes}{TRUE or FALSE. Whether to include residual connections in the encoder, decoder,
and bottleneck/ASPP module blocks. Default is FALSE or no residual connections are included.}

\item{useASPP}{TRUE or FALSE. Whether to use an ASPP module as the bottleneck as opposed to a
double convolution operation. Default is FALSE or the ASPP module is not used as the bottleneck.}

\item{useDS}{TRUE or FALSE. Whether or not to use deep supervision. If TRUE, four predictions are
be made, one at each decoder block resolution, and the predictions will be returned as a list object
containing the 4 predictions. If FALSE, only the final prediction at the original resolution is
returned. Default is FALSE or deep supervision is not implemented.}

\item{enChn}{Vector of 4 integers defining the number of output
feature maps for each of the four encoder blocks. Default is 16, 32, 64, and 128.}

\item{dcChn}{Vector of 4 integers defining the number of output feature
maps for each of the 4 decoder blocks. Default is 128, 64, 32, and 16.}

\item{btnChn}{Number of output feature maps from the bottleneck block. Default
is 256.}

\item{dilRates}{Vector of 5 values specifying the dilation rates used in the ASPP module.
Default is 1, 2, 4, 6, and 16.}

\item{dilChn}{Vector of 5 values specifying the number of channels to produce at each dilation
rate within the ASPP module. Default is 16 for each dilation rate or 80 channels overall.}

\item{negative_slope}{If actFunc = "lrelu", specifies the negative slope term
to use. Default is 0.01.}

\item{seRatio}{Ratio to use in squeeze and excitation module. The default is 8.}

\description{
Define a UNet architecture for semantic segmentation.
}
\details{
Define a UNet architecture with 4 blocks in the encoder, a bottleneck
block, and 4 blocks in the decoder. UNet can accept a variable number of input
channels, and the user can define the number of feature maps produced in each
encoder and decoder block and the bottleneck. Users can also choose to (1) replace
all ReLU activation functions with leaky ReLU or swish, (2) implement attention
gates along the skip connections, (3) implement squeeze and excitation modules within
the encoder blocks, (4) add residual connections within all blocks, (5) replace the
bottleneck with a modified atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module, and/or (6)
implement deep supervision using predictions generated at each stage in the decoder.
