\arguments{
\item{nCls}{Number of classes being differentiated.}

\item{cropFactorMsk}{Number of rows and columns of cells to not include for mask in assessment to
minimize edge effects. Default is 0 or no cropping.}

\item{cropFactorPred}{Number of rows and columns of cells to not include for prediction in assessment to
minimize edge effects. Default is 0 or no cropping.}

\item{lambda}{Term used to control the relative weighting of the distribution- and region-based
losses. Default is 0.5, or equal weighting between the losses. If lambda = 1, only the distribution-
based loss is considered. If lambda = 0, only the region-based loss is considered. Values between 0.5
and 1 put more weight on the distribution-based loss while values between 0 and 0.5 put more
weight on the region-based loss.}

\item{gamma}{Parameter that controls weighting applied to difficult-to-predict pixels (for
distribution-based losses) or difficult-to-predict classes (for region-based losses). Smaller values increase the
weight applied to difficult samples or classes. Default is 1, or no focal weighting is applied. Value must be
less than or equal to 1 and larger than 0.}

\item{delta}{Parameter that controls the relative weightings of false positive and false negative errors for
each class. Different weightings can be provided for each class. The default is 0.6, which results in prioritizing
false negative errors relative to false positive errors.}

\item{smooth}{Smoothing factor to avoid divide-by-zero errors and provide numeric stability. Default is 1e-8.
Recommend using the default.}

\item{zeroStart}{TRUE or FALSE. If class indices start at 0 as opposed to 1, this should be set to
TRUE. This is required  to implement one-hot encoding since R starts indexing at 1. Default is TRUE.}

\item{clsWghtsDist}{Vector of class weights for use in calculating a weighted version of the CE loss.
Default is for all classes to be equally weighted.}

\item{clsWghtsReg}{Vector of class weights for use in calculating a weighted version of the
region-based loss. Default is for all classes to be equally weighted.}

\item{useLogCosH}{TRUE or FALSE. Whether or not to apply a logCosH transformation to the region-based
loss. Default is FALSE.}

\item{device}{Define device being used for computation. Define using torch_device().}
}
\value{
Loss metric for use in training process.

\description{
Define a loss for semantic segmentation using a modified unified focal loss framework as a subclass of torch::nn_module()
}
\details{
Implementation of modified version of the unified focal loss after:

Yeung, M., Sala, E., Schönlieb, C.B. and Rundo, L., 2022. Unified focal loss:
Generalising Dice and cross entropy-based losses to handle class imbalanced
medical image segmentation. Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics, 95, p.102026.

Modifications include (1) allowing users to define class weights for both the distribution-
based and region-based losses, (2) using class weights as opposed to the symmetric and
asymmetric methods implemented by the authors, and (3) including an option to apply
a logcosh transform to the region-based loss.

This loss has three key hyperparameters that control its implementation. Lambda controls
the relative weight of the distribution- and region-based losses. Default is 0.5,
or equal weighting between the losses is applied. If lambda = 1, only the distribution-
based loss is considered. If lambda = 0, only the region-based loss is considered. Values between 0.5
and 1 put more weight on the distribution-based loss while values between 0 and 0.5 put more
weight on the region-based loss.

Gamma controls the application of focal loss and the application of
increased weight to difficult-to-predict pixels (for distribution-based losses) or difficult-to-predict
classes (region-based losses). Lower gamma values put increased weight on difficult samples or classes.
Using a value of 1 equates to not using a focal adjustment.

The delta term controls the relative weight of
false positive and false negative errors for each class. The default is 0.6 for each class, which results in
placing a higher weight on false negative as opposed to false positive errors relative to that class.

By adjusting the lambda, gamma, delta, and class weight terms, the user can implement a variety of
different loss metrics including cross entropy loss, weighted cross entropy loss, focal cross entropy
loss, focal weighted cross entropy loss, Dice loss, focal Dice loss, Tversky loss, and focal Tversky
loss.
