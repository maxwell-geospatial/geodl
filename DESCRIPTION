Description: This package provides utilities and functions for semantic segmentation
  of geospatial data using convolutional neural network-based deep learning. Functions
  allow for creating masks, image chips, data frames listing image chips in a directory, 
  and datasets for use within data loaders. A basic UNet architecture is provided, and more
  UNet-like architectures will be made available in later releases. Dice and Dice-like
  loss metrics are also avaialble along with F1-score, recall, and precision assessment
  metrics implemented with luz. Trained models can be used to predict to spatial data 
  without the need to generate chips from larger spatial extents. The package relies on 
  torch for implementing deep learning, which does not require the installation or a 
  Pyton environment. Raster geospatial data are handled with terra. Models can be 
  trained using a CUDA-enabled GPU; however, multi-GPU training is not supported by 
  terra. Both binary and multiclass models can be trained.
